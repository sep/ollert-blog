    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted August 22, 2014, by <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/08/22/fixing-some-minor-bugs-in-trellos-client-dot-js/">Larry Price</a>.</em></p>

<p>I&rsquo;m a huge fan of <a href="https://trello.com">Trello</a>, and I recently created an app to analyze Trello data called <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>. Ollert makes heavy use of the <a href="http://trello.com/docs">Trello API</a>. I&rsquo;ve written previously about <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/03/18/connecting-to-the-trello-api/">using Trello&rsquo;s client.js to connect to the Trello API</a>.</p>

<p>During some ad-hoc testing of opening/closing the Trello authorization popup, I found that clicking &ldquo;Deny&rdquo; on the popup, reopening it, and then clicking &ldquo;Connect&rdquo; resulted in me not being able to connect. I spent some time looking into workarounds and I even contacted Trello support. After studying <a href="https://trello.com/1/client.coffee">client.coffee</a>, I eventually found the problem: the Trello client keeps around an anonymous object called <code>ready</code> that stores some session data. When a user clicks &lsquo;Deny&rsquo;, this <code>ready</code> object remembers. I was able to fix the Deny/Allow issue by pulling down a local copy of client.js and making an interface change to the module:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript client.js">clearReady: function() {
  ready = {}
}
</code></pre>

<p>From <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/07/07/deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client/">another issue I was having</a>, I already call <code>Trello.deauthorize()</code> before my application attempts to contact Trello, so now I also make a call to <code>Trello.clearReady()</code>. My <code>authorize()</code> function looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript trello-controller.js">var authorize = function (expires, callback) {
  Trello.deauthorize();
  Trello.clearReady();

  Trello.authorize({
    name: "Ollert",
    type: "popup",
    interactive: true,
    expiration: expires,
    persist: false,
    success: callback,
    scope: {
      read: true,
      write: true
    }
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Since I&rsquo;ve pulled client.js locally, I&rsquo;m no longer sending my developer token when I load the file. I manually set my key when the page loads, but this could just as easily be done in my <code>authorize</code> method above.</p>

<pre><code class="javascript layout.haml">:javascript
  $(document).ready(function() {
    Trello.setKey("#{ENV['PUBLIC_KEY']}")
  });
</code></pre>

<p>You can find a copy of my modified client.js <a href="https://gist.github.com/larryprice/1e67ddcd53c686fbc1de">in this Gist</a>.</p>

    <id>http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-testing-through-a-trello-connection-with-capybara-and-webkit</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted August 7, 2014, by <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/08/07/testing-through-the-trello-api-with-capybara-and-webkit/">Larry Price</a>.</em></p>

<p>During the hardening of <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>, a Trello data analysis tool I wrote, I started writing acceptance tests. I quickly ran into an issue where the meat of my application requires opening pop-up window, signing into Trello, and allowing my application access.</p>

<p>I created a test user on Trello with a few varied boards to allow for proper testing. In doing this, I store the user&rsquo;s login information in my .env file. For the most part, I can use the steps provided in <a href="https://gist.github.com/larryprice/546d6c029bb3074bd84c">this common web_steps.rb</a>.</p>

<pre><code class="cucumber Connecting.feature">Feature: Landing

Background:
  Given I am on the landing page

@javascript
Scenario: Deny connecting to Trello
  Given I follow "Connect to Get Started"
  And I press "Deny" on the Trello popup
  Then I should be on the landing page

@javascript
Scenario: Allow connecting to Trello
  Given I follow "Connect to Get Started"
  When I authorize with Trello as the test user
  Then I should not see "Connecting..."
  And I should not see "Redirecting..."
  And I should be on the boards page
</code></pre>

<p>When the Trello popup appears, we have to specify the window we&rsquo;re going to use. Since I&rsquo;m using <a href="https://github.com/thoughtbot/capybara-webkit">capybara-webkit</a>, I&rsquo;m going to go ahead and do all of my Trello popup activities in one step, which saves me from writing a lot of unnecessary steps.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby trello_popup_steps.rb">When /^I press "(.*?)" on the Trello popup$/ do |button|
  trello_popup = windows.last
  page.within_window trello_popup do
    click_button button
  end
end

When /^I authorize with Trello as the test user$/ do
  trello_popup = windows.last
  page.within_window trello_popup do
    click_link "Log in"

    fill_in "user", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_USERNAME']
    fill_in "password", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_PASSWORD']

    click_button "Log In"
    click_button "Allow"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Straightforward so far. We grab the window handle and we click links, fill in fields, and press buttons within that window.</p>

<p>Note that I&rsquo;m using capybara-webkit, a headless web driver, to run my Javascript. Although the first test (&ldquo;Deny&rdquo;) will pass, the &ldquo;Allow&rdquo; test fails ambiguously. This is because capybara-webkit is not recognized as a supported browser by the Trello popup.</p>

<p>Anecdotally, I contacted Trello support about this and received the following response:</p>

<blockquote><p>Currently it is not possible to test this with a headless browser as you are looking to do without getting the unsupported browser message.</p></blockquote>

<p>So I guess we should just give up, right? &hellip;Or we could manipulate the headers we send to load the Trello popup such that Trello <em>thinks</em> we are Google Chromium.</p>

<pre><code class="cucumber trello_popup_steps.rb">When /^I authorize with Trello as the test user$/ do
  trello_popup = windows.last
  page.within_window trello_popup do
    page.driver.header(
      "User-Agent",
      "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/34.0.1847.116 Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36"
    )

    click_link "Log in"

    fill_in "user", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_USERNAME']
    fill_in "password", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_PASSWORD']

    click_button "Log In"
    click_button "Allow"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Fantastic. Now my tests pass. I can&rsquo;t sleep at night, but my tests pass.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, that won&rsquo;t be the case if I add more tests to this <code>.feature</code> file. Hidden somewhere deep in the browser&rsquo;s cache or cookies or somethings, Trello is remembering that we logged in sometimes. Sometimes it even remembers that someone else has logged in. The UI of the Trello popup changes based on whether it thinks you&rsquo;ve already logged in. In order to keep things consistent, I like to add an if-statement to take care of this case.</p>

<pre><code class="cucumber trello_popup_steps.rb">When /^I authorize with Trello as the test user$/ do
  trello_popup = windows.last
  page.within_window trello_popup do
    page.driver.header(
      "User-Agent",
      "Mozilla/5.0 (X11; Linux x86_64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Ubuntu Chromium/34.0.1847.116 Chrome/34.0.1847.116 Safari/537.36"
    )

    if page.has_content? "Switch Accounts"
      click_link "Switch Accounts"
    else
      click_link "Log in"
    end

    fill_in "user", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_USERNAME']
    fill_in "password", with: ENV['TEST_USER_TRELLO_PASSWORD']

    click_button "Log In"
    click_button "Allow"
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>Edge cases addressed. Now I can make connections to Trello and test my application. Be warned, I&rsquo;ve already had these tests break once when Trello updated the UI behind the Trello popup. If Trello ever stops supporting Chromium 34.0, these tests are also likely to stop working. These tests are most useful during development, when we have the potential to break the Trello connection ourselves, and so I think they are well worth the pain of potential future maintenance.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-testing-automated-emails-with-email-spec-in-cucumber/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-03T14:55:30-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-testing-automated-emails-with-email-spec-in-cucumber</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted July 12, 2014, by <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/07/12/testing-automated-emails-with-email-spec-in-cucumber/">Larry Price</a>.</em></p>

<p>Now that <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/07/07/deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client/">I send emails using Pony</a>, I want to be able to verify that the emails are being generated correctly. I also don&rsquo;t want to send real emails and have my tests check an inbox somewhere. I found a couple of solutions to do this, including <a href="https://github.com/johnmendonca/pony-test">pony-test</a> and <a href="https://github.com/bmabey/email-spec">email-spec</a>. Although pony-test fits my needs perfectly, the last commit was December 27, 2011 (2.5 years ago at the time of this post), and thus was using an outdated version of <a href="https://github.com/jnicklas/capybara">capybara</a> which I was unwilling to use. Fortunately, pony-spec is mostly just a fork of email-spec with all the non-Pony components ripped out.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to be using Cucumber to test my emails, but email-spec also boasts compatibility with rspec and Turnip. To get started:</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ gem install email-spec
</code></pre>

<p>The developers of email-spec were kind enough to give us some free step definitions. If I was using rails, I could just type <code>rails generate email_spec:steps</code>, but since I&rsquo;m using Sinatra I opted just to copy-paste the file into my <code>step_definitions/</code> directory. You can find <code>email_steps.rb</code> <a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bmabey/email-spec/master/lib/generators/email_spec/steps/templates/email_steps.rb">on Github</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/07/07/deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client/">my last post about small horses and emails</a>, I used the following code to send a confirmation email on signup:</p>

<pre><code class="ruby web.rb"># ...
post '/signup' do
  user = User.create! params

  url = "#{request.base_url}/account/reset/#{user.generate_verification_hash}"
  Pony.mail(
    to: user.email,
    from: "MyApp Help Desk &lt;noreply@myapp.com&gt;",
    subject: "MyApp Account Verification",
    body: "A request has been made to verify your MyApp account (https://myapp.com)." +
          "If you made this request, go to " + url + ". If you did not make this request, ignore this email.",
    html_body: haml(
      :verify_account_email,
      layout: false,
      locals: {
        email: user.email,
        date: DateTime.now.strftime("%H:%M:%S%P %B %d, %Y"),
        ip: request.ip,
        url: url
      }
    )
  )
end
# ...
</code></pre>

<pre><code class="haml /views/verify_account_email.haml">%p
  Hello!
%p
  An account verification has been requested for your new &lt;a href="https://myapp.com"&gt;MyApp&lt;/a&gt; account.

%ul
  %li
    Username: #{locals[:email]}
  %li
    Time: #{locals[:date]}
  %li
    IP address: #{locals[:ip]}

%p
  If you made this request, click the link below or copy-paste the following URL into your browser to verify your account:

%p
  %a{href: "#{locals[:url]}", alt: "Verify", title: "Click to verify account"}
    #{locals[:url]}

%p
  If you did not request this new account, please ignore this email.

%p
  Sincerely,
  %br
  Team MyApp

%p
  This email account is not monitored and will not receive replies. For more information, contact &lt;a href="mailto:connect@myapp.com"&gt;connect@myapp.com&lt;/a&gt;.
</code></pre>

<p>Given the pre-defined steps from email-spec, testing that this email gets sent is a breeze. Adding a scenario to my feature file:</p>

<pre><code class="cucumber features/SignupConfirmation.feature">Feature: Signup Confirmation
  As a new user
  When I sign up
  I should receive a confirmation email

Background:
  Given a clear email queue
  When I go to the signup page
  And I fill in "email" with "prez@whitehouse.gov"
  And I fill in "password" with "bunnies"
  And I press "Sign Up"
  Then "prez@whitehouse.gov" should receive an email

Scenario: Receives email with correct contents
  When "prez@whitehouse.gov" opens the email
  Then they should see the email delivered from "MyApp Help Desk &lt;noreply@myapp.com&gt;"
  And they should see "MyApp Account Verification" in the email subject
  And they should see "Username: prez@whitehouse.gov" in the email body
  And they should see "An account verification has been requested"
</code></pre>

<p>That&rsquo;s it. Now we know that an email like the one above will be sent during signup. What we can&rsquo;t test here is that our SMTP server (or equivalent) is working, so in reality I&rsquo;m only testing that the email will attempt to send that looks like the one I test against.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-03T14:55:06-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted June 7, 2014, by <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/07/07/deauthorizing-token-with-the-trello-client/">Larry Price</a>.</em></p>

<p>In my <a href="https://ollertapp.com">application</a>, a user can connect to Trello without logging in. Whenever this &ldquo;anonymous&rdquo; user hits the landing page, I attempt to force the <a href="https://trello.com/docs/gettingstarted/clientjs.html">Trello client</a> to authorize the user again. By doing this, the user can return to the landing page whenever he or she likes to switch usernames. My authorize code looks like this:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function AuthenticateTrelloAlways() {
  Trello.authorize({
    name: "Ollert",
    type: "popup",
    interactive: true,
    expiration: "1hour",
    persist: false,
    success: onAuthorizeSuccessful,
    scope: {
      read: true
    },
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>This works oh-so-wonderfully in Chrome and Firefox, but, even during the hackathon which spawned <a href="https://ollertapp.com">Ollert</a>, we noticed that IE10/11 were causing some unexpected issues. Authorization would work the first time the user hit the landing page, but on subsequent visits telling Trello to Allow or Deny access resulted in the popup showing a white screen and never calling my callback function. Closing and reopening IE would allow me to authorize once, presumably until the &ldquo;1hour&rdquo; that I requested the original token for expired. I also verified this problem existed in IE9.</p>

<p>After several hours tweeting obscenities about IE, I stumbled upon the answer while browsing the source code for Trello&rsquo;s <a href="https://trello.com/1/client.coffee">client.coffee</a>. About one third of the way through the code, I found this function:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript"># Clear any existing authorization
deauthorize: -&gt;
  token = null
  writeStorage("token", token)
  return
</code></pre>

<p>All this code does is unset the class variable <code>token</code> and unset the local store variable of the same name. So I changed my <code>AuthenticateTrelloAlways()</code> method:</p>

<pre><code class="javascript">function AuthenticateTrelloAlways() {
  Trello.deauthorize();

  Trello.authorize({
    name: "Ollert",
    type: "popup",
    interactive: true,
    expiration: "1hour",
    persist: false,
    success: onAuthorizeSuccessful,
    scope: {
      read: true
    },
  });
}
</code></pre>

<p>Voilà. Why does this only happen in IE? I was originally going to blame the local store, but, since I was able to reproduce the defect in IE9 (no HTML5), I no longer believe that to be the case. I&rsquo;m currently resigned to chalk it up as IE just being IE.</p>

    <link href="http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-using-sqlite-with-heroku/"/>
    <updated>2014-12-03T14:54:34-05:00</updated>
    <id>http://blog.ollertapp.com/blog/2014/12/03/larry-price-using-sqlite-with-heroku</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p><em>Originally posted March 29, 2014, by <a href="http://www.larry-price.com/blog/2014/03/29/using-sqlite-on-heroku/">Larry Price</a>.</em></p>

<p>Or rather, &ldquo;Not Using sqlite on Heroku.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="//heroku.com">Heroku</a> does not support <a href="//sqlite.org">sqlite</a>. That doesn&rsquo;t mean we have to stop using sqlite in development, but it does mean we need to put in some workarounds to support our deployment environment. The rest of this article will use <a href="//ruby-lang.org">ruby</a> and <a href="//sinatrarb.com">Sinatra</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming you have a heroku app deployed and you have sqlite already working locally, this only takes a few steps. First we need to add a SQL database to our heroku app. From the project directory, we&rsquo;ll add the <a href="//addons.heroku.com/heroku-postgresql">heroku-postgresql</a> addon to our app.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ heroku addons:add heroku-postgresql:dev
</code></pre>

<p>The <code>dev</code> piece of this command tells heroku we want the small, free database. This database supports up to 10,000 rows and has a 99.5% uptime. Best of all: it&rsquo;s free. Other options have you pay $9/mo for 10,000,000 rows or $50+ for Unlimited usage. I recommend you start small.</p>

<p>Hopefully you got some success statements after adding heroku-postgresql. They should have included some new environment variables, which are links to your new Postgres database. Record these; we&rsquo;ll use them a little later.</p>

<p>Now we need to set up the back-end to be able to access a Postgres database when necessary. Hopefully you&rsquo;re using a decent abstraction library in your app that can access any SQL database. For ruby, I find <a href="//www.sequel.rubyforge.org/">Sequel</a> to be sufficient.</p>

<p>In our Gemfile, we&rsquo;ve probably already included the sqlite gem for use in our local environment. We can go ahead and move that into a <code>development</code> block, and we need to add the <code>pg</code> gem to either <code>production</code> or the global block.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby Gemfile">source "https://rubygems.org"

ruby '2.1.0'

gem 'bundler'
gem 'rake'
gem 'sinatra'
gem 'haml'
gem 'sequel'

group :production do
  gem 'pg'
end

group :development do
  gem 'sqlite3'
end
</code></pre>

<p>Heroku sets <code>ENV['RACK_ENV']</code> to &ldquo;production&rdquo; for us, which means that the pg gem should get picked up the next time we deploy. Now we need to tell our app which database to use in which situation.</p>

<p>One of the easiest places to make this decision is in Sinatra&rsquo;s <code>configure</code> block. I keep my local db in an environment variable called <code>LOCAL_DATABASE_URL</code>. This is where you use the environment variable heroku set for you when you set up your Postgres database; mine was called <code>HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_MAROON_URL</code>.</p>

<pre><code class="ruby web.rb">class App &lt; Sinatra::Base
  configure :production do
    Sequel.connect ENV['HEROKU_POSTGRESQL_MAROON_URL']
  end

  configure :development do
    Sequel.connect ENV['LOCAL_DATABASE_URL']
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>This works because the default environment is &ldquo;development.&rdquo; Test locally, and then we can deploy.</p>

<pre><code class="bash">$ git push heroku master
</code></pre>

<p>And enjoy.</p>
